# Probability: Chapter 1

## Definitions, axioms, correlated events
- A **random variable $$x$ is a variable which has a set of possible outcomes $$S=\{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\}$$. These can be
    - discrete, like rolling a die $$(S=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\})$$, or
    - continuous, like the velocity of a particle $$S=\{-\infty \leq v_x, v_y, v_z \leq \infty\}$$
