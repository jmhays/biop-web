#### A few notes:
We may be able to condense the Thermodynamics lectures into two parts depending on the class’s familiarity with basic thermo. If we can condense, I will use that extra time to either dive more into Ensemble Theory or cover some additional material on phase transitions. Let’s see how we do.
