1. **Glasses:** Liquid quartz, if cooled slowly, crystallizes at a temperature $$T_m$$, and releases latent heat $$L$$. Under more rapid cooling conditions, the liquid is supercooled and becomes glassy.

a) As both phases of quartz are almost incompressible, there is no work input, and changes
in internal energy satisfy $$dE = T dS + \mu dN$$. Use the mathematical properties of extensivity to obtain

$$\mu = \frac{E - TS}{N}$$

b) The heat capacity of crystalline quartz is approximately $$C_X = \alpha T^3$$, while that of
glassy quartz is roughly $$C_G = \beta T$$, where $$\alpha$$ and $$\beta$$ are constants.
Assuming that the third law of thermodynamics applies to both crystalline and glass
phases $$(S(T = 0) = 0)$$, calculate the entropies of the two phases at temperatures $$T\leq T_m$$.

c) At zero temperature the local bonding structure is similar in glass and crystalline
quartz, so that they have approximately the same internal energy $$E_0$$. Calculate the
internal energies of both phases at temperatures $$T\leq T_m$$.

d) Use the condition of thermal equilibrium between two phases $$(\mu_{glass} = \mu_{crystal})$$ to compute the equilibÂ­rium melting temperature $$T_m$$ in terms of $$\alpha$$ and $$\beta$$.

e) Compute the latent heat $$L$$ in terms of $$\alpha$$ and $$\beta$$.

f) Is the result in the previous part correct? If not, which of the steps leading to it is
most likely to be incorrect?

### Relationships you may need

#### A mathematical way to describe "extensivity":

$$\lambda S(E,N) = S(\lambda E, \lambda N)$$

#### Latent heat: the heat required to convert a solid into a liquid or vapor, or a liquid into a vapor, without change of temperature.
