1. Assuming that ~~stars~~ metabolites are randomly distributed in the ~~galaxy~~ cell with a density $$\alpha$$, show that the probability of finding the nearest ~~star~~ metabolite at a distance $$R$$ from the ~~earth~~ nucleus is $$p(R) = 4\pi R^2 \alpha \exp\left({-\frac{4\pi}{3}}\right)$$. #biology
