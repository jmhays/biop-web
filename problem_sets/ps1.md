1. (10 pts) **Poisson distribution of stars in the galaxy**. Assuming that ~~stars~~ metabolites are randomly distributed in the ~~galaxy~~ cell with a density $$\alpha$$, show that the probability of finding the nearest ~~star~~ metabolite at a distance $$R$$ from the ~~earth~~ nucleus is $$p(R) = 4\pi R^2 \alpha \exp\left({-\frac{4\pi}{3}} R^3 \alpha\right)$$. #biology

2. (40 pts) **Lipid orientation in a nanodisc. Kind of.** :confused: $$N$$ spins are equally spaced around a circle in the *x-y* plane. Each spin can point either parallel or antiparallel to the $$z$$ direction. Niether orientation is preferred. However, the spins interact with each other through a nearest neighbor interaction. If two neighboring spins point in the same direction, they contribute an amount $$−J$$ to the total energy; if they point in opposite directions, they contribute an amount $$J$$. Thus the total energy of the system depends on the number of reversals, $$R$$, that occur around the ring.

$$E = JR − J(N − R) = J(2R − N)$$

a) (5 pts) Assume $$N$$ is even. What are the smallest and largest values that $$R$$ can have? What are the minimum and maximum values of $$E$$?

b) (10 pts) Find the total number of microscopic states of the system consistent with a given number of reversals, $$\Omega(R)$$. Note that this corresponds to the number of ways the $$R$$ reversals can be distributed among the *N* inter­spin locations.

c) (15 pts) Assume that $$N$$ is large. Find the entropy $$S$$ of the spin chain as a function of $$N$$ and $$R$$.

d) (10 pts) Find the energy of the spin chain as a function of temperature, $$E(T)$$. Make a sketch of the resulting function for the case $$J > 0$$ and indicate the low and high temperature asymptotes (consider only positive $$T$$).

e) (Bonus: 5 pts): Provide some reasons why this is a terrible approximation to lipids in a nanodisc :grin:
